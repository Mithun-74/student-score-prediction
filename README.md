🎓 Student Exam Score Prediction Using Machine Learning

A simple Machine Learning web application built with Flask, HTML/CSS, and scikit-learn, which predicts a student’s final exam score based on their study habits, attendance, and other factors.

🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a regression-based ML model that predicts the Final Exam Score of students based on several academic and behavioral features.

The frontend is built using HTML + CSS, while the backend uses Flask to serve predictions from the trained model.
The application is deployed using Render for easy access.
